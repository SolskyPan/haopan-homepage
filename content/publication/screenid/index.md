abstract: Quick response (QR) codes have been widely used in mobile applications due to its convenience and the pervasive built-in cameras on smartphones. Recently, however, attacks against QR codes have been reported that attackers can capture a QR code of the victim and replay it to achieve a fraudulent transaction or intercept private information, just before the original QR code is scanned. In this study, we enhance the security of a QR code by identifying its authenticity. We propose SCREENID, which embeds a QR code with information of the screen which displays it, thereby the QR code can reveal whether it is reproduced by an adversary or not. In SCREENID, PWM frequency of screens is exploited as the unique screen fingerprint. To improve the estimation accuracy of PWM frequency, SCREENID incorporates a model for the interaction between the camera and screen in the temporal and spatial domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCREENID can differentiate screens of different models, types, and manufacturers, thus improve the security of QR codes.
